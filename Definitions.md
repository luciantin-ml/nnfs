- Artificial Neural Network 
 type of machine learning
  
- Deep Neural Network
 defining characteristic is having two or more hidden layers (layers that the neural network controls)
  
- NN are used for classification and regression

- Supervised and unsupervised learning

- Supervised learning is used when we have pre-established and labeled data that can be used for training

- Unsupervised learning is when a nn finds structure in the data without knowing the labels/classes

- A feature is for ex. an output of a temp. sensor, a group of features makes up a feature set ( represented as vectors/arrays)

- Samples are fed to the neural network models to train them to fit desired outputs from these inputs or to predict based on them during the inference phase

- The "normal" or "failure" labels are classifications or labels ( or targets or ground truths)

- Backpropagation, Activation Function

- Dense layer is a layer of neurons where each neuron of this layer is connected to each neuron of the previous and next layer

- Each connection between neurons has a weight associated with it, which is a trainable factor of how much of this input to use, and this weight gets multiplied by the input value

- Once all of the inputs*weights flow iinto our neuron, they are summed, and a bias, another trainable parameter is added. 

- Bias is used to offset the output positively or negatively, which can further help us map more real-world types of dynamic data

- Weights and biases are "knobs" that  we can tune to fit our model to data

- Output = weight * input + bias  (linear function like y = mx + b)

- Bias is the y offset and weight controls the slope of the function
